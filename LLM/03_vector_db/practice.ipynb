Examination of the entrance shows many traces of where other cars have scraped against the sides of the entrance, so it is evident that other motorists have sustained damage to their cars on this entrance. Parking on the street in front of the hotel is possible though, but it is not free, and as it is a fairly busy street, there is thus no assurance that a parked car will not be damaged there either.,\n",

      "Hotel is completely outdated and in need of renovation.\n",
      "Upon arrival the room was not cleaned, fingerprints and hairs of the previous hotel guests were abundant, and this during covid period.\n",
      "The bathroom was completely worn, mold spots in and around the shower and sink, stains on walls and ceilings, taps worn, rusted and completely calcified. Windows hadn't been cleaned for weeks, the handles were literally black with dirt.\n",
      "The renovation work already carried out looked more like amateurish bricolage than thorough renovation (laminate simply laid over the old fitted carpet, holes in the walls for extra cabling).\n",
      "When reported to the counter, the friendliness of the staff quickly deteriorated. A cleaning lady was sent on the spot who apparently lacked a special product (= Antical). Unfortunately she was only in possession of a spray with Javel but would certainly report this to the 'Manager'. A good morning from the staff turned out to be no longer an option. However, the hotel apparently has a rather high reputation when it comes to friendliness of the staff.\n",
      "Despite the multiple positive scores for breakfast, this was also a disappointment.\n",
      "A very classic and standard breakfast was offered 'corona proof', but if you wanted a glass of cava, each guest had to take the same bottles to pour themselves during covid. Moreover, the waiter on duty didn't speak the Dutch language. The dining room turned out not to be cleaned either, dust and food remains of previous guests were easily spotted.\n",

Towards an unbearable heat and with the air conditioning not working could not be in the room, for which I had to open the balcony doors throughout the night, resulting in the entry of mosquitoes that \"fried\" me to bites all the night. I do not find it acceptable, that having booked a suite, upon arrival there will not work main services such as air conditioning and wifi. These things should be checked before offering the room in web portals. The direction of the hotel the first night remained totally passive, and did not react until the next day.

      "Breakfast was excellent with the same attention paid to detail as in all other aspects of our stay.ing and sincere owners of a B&B we have met. The exceptionally well maintained and attention is paid to every detail for your experience.   The location, about an 8 min cycle into historical Diest is perfect if you are travelling by bike. There is also a great little grocery store a few minutes walk away if you need any provisions. Water, tea, coffee, milk (for your tea or coffee) and beer are all available for you in the kitchen and Sharon asks you to make yourself at home. There were even chocolates on the bed when we arrived in our room.  The only downside is that there is a shared bathroom, not an issue during our visit since we were the only guests that night but not something we noticed when we booked and something that we usually avoid. Sharon has gone to efforts to make this work with robes in each room for guests transiting to and from the facilities, an ‘in use or available’ sign on the door and space for storage of toiletries etc assigned for each room in the bathroom.\n",

The rooms were already cleaned and ready, yet a new staff member asked me to pay 30 euros for advance occupancy of the room (so for about 2 hours)... They had never done this before. Only when I insisted that I always stay at this hotel when in Belgium did they allow me in the room.  Also the parking is no longer free and is now 12 euros a day...

Easy to park before the house and free parking available within 10 minutes walk. The city center is very close, within 10 min walking distance. The host, Tatjana was very helpful and was happy to assist in case of any questions, available as well by phone through the whole day. We will definitely come back in Christmas time for another weekend :)\n",

      "This is not a hotel but an airbnb type apartment, but it was very good. We were three people (my girlfriend and her friend and me) and we had two separate rooms: one in the first floor and another in the second floor. Both are spacious. The entire apartment was very clean. The owner was very nice and helpful. I would stay here when I have a chance to visit Bruges again.\n",

      "리뷰: Everything was perfect but if I really have to mention something, I would say the absence of a kettle, tea/infusion bags and cups with grip, as well as the fact that the fridge was empty. Indeed, when I arrived at the hotel I had to work straight away and then I attended an evening course online. Eventually, I did not have time to order any dinner from the list I received and, when I went out to look for restaurants, the majority was already closed and the ones I called did not deliver anymore at that time. So I did not have any dinner at all 😅. Fortunately, I had at least water with me. If in the fridge there had been some snacks, it would have been perfect. Furthermore, as to the absence of a kettle, it is true that a microwave is available in a common room, which was very close to mine. I also used it but I have to say that it was not always so practical. The first night I did not have any cups, so I used two glasses instead, but they burned, so I had to use some tissues to protect my hands😅. The second night I kept a cup from the breakfast but still it burned, as the cup did not have any grip😅. The third night I kept even the charcuterie tray from the breakfast and, like this, it was perfect 👌🏻, so easy to move the hot cup from the common room to my room. In any case, it was not a big inconvenience, I just had to adapt a bit. \n",
      "Furthermore, I think that kettles are present in other types of rooms (superior).,\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked everything. The staff was so kind. They offered me a bigger room for the same price as the smaller. They gave me a list of open restaurants which offered delivery and take-away options - really useful, it would be much difficult to find a place to have lunch or dinner without this list. Moreover, the receptionists were able to face and solve a problem (by mistake, I had booked one night less than I needed) with kindness and professionalism and accommodated my requests and needs.\n",
      "The position is wonderful, located in one of the main shopping streets of Blankenberge, only a few minutes by foot both from the railway station and from the seafront. Very close to the public library and to the Villa Belle Époque.\n",
      "The breakfast was gargantuan! So rich, good and varied: both savory (charcuterie, salmon, different types of cheese, eggs, tomatoes) and sweet (viennoiserie, different types of jam, Nutella, lotus, yogurt), chocolate or coffee, butter, milk, fresh orange juice, different types of bread. In this period of pandemic, breakfast was served individually in each room.\n",
      "My room, even though small, was cozy, confortable and clean. The only thing I would have appreciated might be a kettle with some tea bags and some snacks/drinks in the fridge. The toilet had a confortable shower stall.\n",
      "The hotel is also equipped with a sauna, hammam and jacuzzi, which I tried one afternoon. You have to book it at the reception. I paid eur 40 and for two hours I had it all for me. Hammam was one of the best ever tried, with different and user-friendly functionalities, such as music which changed depending on the programme chosen (relax, purify), chromoterapy, but what I really adored was the scented rain❤️. Sauna was perfect. Jacuzzi was a coup de cœur as for the hammam. So relaxing! I appreciated that I was provided with everything I needed, such as different towels, a bathrobe and a blanket for the relaxing phase.\n",

Stairs can be a bit difficult for people who has mobility issues.\n",

Provided us bus card, bikes to go to Dinant and told the best way to Brussels etc . Car gps was taking us via hilly path via Rue de Nannes which we find bit tricky. Owners told us to go to directly to Namur then which leads us to motorway E411 very smoothly. In short we really like the property and would like to go back to in future\n",

      "리뷰: We stayed for 3 night but each day our key did not work and had to be returned to reception to be recoded. This was inconvenient because we were on the 6th floor and one night I was unwell and needed to use the bathroom but couldn’t get back into the room. It was very distressing because the staff were not concerned and told my husband the machine was broken and they couldn’t fix it. Luckily I found a bathroom in the foyer,\n",
